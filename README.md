# 📊 Inventory Sales Dashboard

### Turning Inventory Data into Business Decisions

## 📌 Project Overview

Inventory mismanagement directly impacts profitability — overstock ties down capital, while understock leads to lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.

This project presents a dynamic **Inventory Sales Dashboard built in Microsoft Excel** to help decision-makers monitor stock performance, identify risk areas, and improve procurement strategy.

The goal was not just to visualize numbers, but to translate raw inventory data into actionable business insights.

## 🎯 Business Problem

The business needed clarity on:

* Which products are running below their reorder levels?
* Are we overstocking certain products?
* Which categories are most exposed to stock risk?
* Which suppliers contribute most to inventory volume?
* How is inventory distributed across warehouse locations?

Without structured analysis, these decisions rely on guesswork.
